# anirona/web

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

By default, the web app will pull its data from a Google Storage bucket. This isn't easily customizable yet but you can edit the path in `src/components/AnimatedMap.tsx`
